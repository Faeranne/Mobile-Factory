	Description:
	Placing LabTiles (not stone brick, Dim. Tiles, etc) can destroy Equalizer and kill player.

	createTilesAtPosition does not pass the oldTile to set_tiles if the new tile is tutorial-grid or void. Somehow this *not* replacement triggers the destroy check.

	Status:
	2020-05-07 - reproducible, unresolved, not intending to fix
